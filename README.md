# Uttarakhand Rhesus Macaque Identification System: An Automated Approach

This project is aimed at detecting and recognising (if already available in our database) or adding new individuals in our database.
Detection is done using a fine tuned (specially for rhesus macaque) Haar Cascade (MacaqueFrontalFaceModel.xml) which is only aimed at detecting the frontal face. A new Haar Cascade for profile view of an individual is also currently in development)

A working GUI for the same is currently under development (See mainWindow.py)
